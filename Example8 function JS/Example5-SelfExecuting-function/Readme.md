1. The self-executing function is a function in JavaScript that doesn’t need to be called for its execution it executes itself as soon as it is created</br></br>

2. The advantage of using a self-executing function rather than writing the code directly is that the variables and functions defined within the anonymous function are not available to the code outside it.</br></br>

3. We will invoke the self-invoking functions only once because after the execution we’ll loose the reference to the function.</br></br>
